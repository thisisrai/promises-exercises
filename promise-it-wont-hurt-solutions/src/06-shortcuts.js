// ## Task
//
// We don’t have any specific task we’d like to assign to you for this lesson.
// Feel free to explore all three functions at your own pace. When you are
// preparing to submit though, make sure you are using at least catch and one
// of Promise.resolve and Promise.reject ☺

var promise = Promise.reject("This should fail");

promise.catch(console.log);
